****Assume a user have entered their age in a program. The value is stored in register r16.
Write a program such that if the age is above 18, you store the value 1 in register r20, otherwise you
store the value 2 in r20. After the check, you shall just enter an infinite loop****

.org 0x0000
main:
 ldi r16, 18 ; Load the value 18 into r16 (Age threshold)
 ldi r20, 15 ; Load a test user's age into r20 (Assumed user's age)
 cp r20, r16 ; Compare r20 (user's age) with r16 (age threshold) brge above_or_equal_to_18 ; Branch if r20 is greater than or equal to 18
 ; Age is below 18
 ldi r20, 2 ; Store 2 in r20
 rjmp infinite_loop ; Jump to the infinite loop
above_or_equal_to_18:
 ; Age is greater than or equal to 18
 ldi r20, 1 ; Store 1 in r20
infinite_loop:
 rjmp infinite_loop ; Enter an infinite loop
